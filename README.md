# ahk-scripts
AutoHotKey scripts (Windows).

-Alt-drag feature (similar to most Linux distros)

-Hide min/max icons

-Hide taskbar and titlebar icons

-Fixup: fixes some bs with my hide min/max buttons script I'd implement it within said script but for some reason they don't work together... don't ask me why, I have no idea (for now).

**Requires autohotkey - you can either compile ahk files to .exe or run them directly**

**Place scripts inside the windows startup folder to run them right after logging in: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup**
